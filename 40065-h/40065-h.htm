<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>A perusal of Captain <span class="sc">Lugard's</span> <i>Rise of our East African Empire</i>
fills one
with a thrill of pride at being also an Englishman. Captain <span class="sc">Lugard</span> is a
Soldier of Fortune, of the type of <i>Quentin Durward</i>, only, instead of
lending his sword to a foreign king, he helps to carve out empire for England in the
very heart of Africa. This is, however, merely an accident. He reached
Massowah bent upon joining the Italian forces then fighting against the
Abyssinians. This journey was undertaken for what, to my Baronite's peace-loving
disposition, is the oddest reason in the world. Finding himself with his
regiment at Gibraltar in December 1888, his health shattered in the Burmah
campaign, Captain <span class="sc">Lugard</span> came to the conclusion that nothing would do
him good except a little fighting. So, with £50 in his belt, and no outfit except
his rifle, he got on board the first passing ship, and sailed whithersoever it
chanced to be going. This turned out to be Naples, a fortunate stroke, since
Italy was the only nation that chanced at the moment to be at war. Captain
<span class="sc">Lugard's</span> efforts to obtain permission to join the expeditionary force,
made first at Rome, and afterwards at Dogali, were unsuccessful. He drifted into
East Africa, and finally reached Uganda, with which territory, particularly
interesting just now, much of the book is concerned. It is impossible even to
hint at the marvellous adventures through which he made his way. They
were accomplished with marvellous endurance and superb courage, the picturesque
narrative being written with charming modesty. No more stirring
story has been told in recent years than Messrs. <span class="sc">Blackwood</span> publish in
these two handsome volumes, profusely illustrated and enriched with maps.</p>

<p>A few hints to those about to marry in <i>Courtship and Marriage</i>, by
<span class="sc">Annie
Swan</span>. Miss <span class="sc">Annie Swan</span> is a Duck!</p>

<p>The latest "Outs" published by "<span class="sc">Innes</span>" are <i>The Dainty Books</i>, a
charming series, containing some very pretty stories; that of a little girl, always
aiming at dramatic effects, in <i>A Hit and a Miss</i>, by the Hon. <span class="sc">Eva
Knatchbull-Hugessen</span>, is most amusingly told, and The <i>Lily and the Water Lily</i> is a
delicate flowery romance by Mrs. <span class="sc">A. Comyns Carr</span>, in which flowers and
fairies talk and act for the benefit of some little children.</p>

<p>Those who have bad memories should get the <i>Dictionary of Quotations</i>,
compiled by Rev. <span class="sc">James Wood</span>. It is not a Stock Exchange memorandum,
but a compilation of more than the usual stock quoted from various writers.</p>

<p>Distinguished for his art gems, <span class="sc">Raphael Tuck and Son</span> are as Artful as
ever with their variety show of cards and booklets.</p>

<p>In consequence of the high price of coals this winter, <span class="sc">Faulkner &amp; Co.</span>
have turned our eyes to summer flowers and pictures. Winter being summarily
dismissed, is not on the cards.</p>

<p>A splendid collection of <i>Good Words</i> for 1893, published by <span class="sc">Isbister</span>, and
edited by <span class="sc">Donald Macleod</span>, D.D.; in it will be found a serial story by
<span class="sc">Edna Lyall</span>. "To Right the Wrong," which proves how wrong it is to write,&mdash;but
read this, and right through, says the</p>

<h2 class="sans">HOW TO WRITE A CHEAP CHRISTMAS NUMBER.</h2>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;We are going to have a seasonable
extra, but can't go to any unnecessary expense. Want a story of
the old kind. Snow, ice, hunting, and plum pudding. Scene must
be laid in an antiquated country-house, to bring in picture of
"Downderry Grange by Moonlight." Can you manage it?</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;Just the thing ready to hand.
Scene Burmah, but can easily bring all the characters to Loamshire.
Central incident. Heroine run over by a wild elephant,
easily changed into an accident on the railway. Have you any
blocks you can send me?</p>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;Sending you heaps of cuts by the
parcels post. Choose those you like best, and return the remainder.
Isn't railway incident rather stale? Better stick to elephant.
Possibly introduce a topical tone. Think you will find in parcel a
sketch of the bombardment of Rio. Do your best.</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;Thanks for packet of blocks.
I have kept half a dozen. Have found a fellow who will do for a
hero. Only drawback he's always changing his personal appearance.
However, can make him an amateur detective. Wrong about the
bombardment of Rio. No picture of that incident. Think you
must have taken "Illumination of Jammeripore, on the occasion of
the Queen's Jubilee," for it. Can work in <i>that</i>, as it will do for one
of my Burmese scenes. Rough sketch of plot. Hero in love with
heroine, who is left alone in lonely manor-house. She meets him
in a circus, where he rescues her from an infuriated elephant.
Brings in three blocks nicely. Hard at work.</p>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;Afraid I must ask you to send back
blocks you have selected. Appears I promised them to another
Contributor, who had written up to them a story called, "Farmer
Foodle's Visit to the Cattle Show." However, retain the Jubilee illumination,
as he says he doesn't want it. Sending you fresh parcel.</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;Rather annoyed, as I was getting on
capitally. <span class="sc">Edwin</span> and <span class="sc">Angelina</span>, on their escape from the mad
elephant, were seeking shelter under the Adelphi Arches. Now come a
lot of pictures of the French Revolution! However, will do my best.</p>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;You are such a good-natured fellow,
it's a shame to bother you. Find I had promised another chap those
revolutionary subjects. He has written a story up to them, called
"Nettleby's Nightmare." Have sent you a heap more in exchange.</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;It's really too bad! I had put
<span class="sc">Edwin</span> in the Conciergerie and <span class="sc">Angelina</span> was trying to bribe
<span class="sc">Robespierre</span>. And now you have altered it all! And what am I
to do with a picture which seems to be an <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'advertisment'">advertisement</ins> of somebody's
shirts? Haven't you made another mistake. However, I have got
on as fast as I can, and put a heap of subjects in a mad scene.
EDWIN'S brain breaks down, and he has visions of lots of things,
inclusive of some wedding-cakes.</p>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;You are quite right. I <i>did</i> make a
mistake. The last packet of blocks were put into my room by mistake.
Please return them at once&mdash;they are required for the
advertisements. Better send in your story as it is, and then I
will find something appropriate. Why <i>will</i> you live in the country?
If you were here, you could settle the whole matter in two twos.</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;I stay in the country because I can't
get inspiration in town. And that's my affair, and not your's.
Pardon this tone of irritation, but I hate altering a story after once
panning out the plot. However, I have obeyed your orders. <span class="sc">Edwin</span>
and <span class="sc">Angelina</span> are born in Burmah (they are cousins), and are taken to
an old English country-house. Then they are told by an old crone
the story of their parents' past. That brings in all the French revolutionary
business. Then I get in the detective part, with a reference
to the undiscovered crime in Cannon Street. You will see it is all right.</p>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;I have read it, and heartily congratulate
you. Just what we wanted. What do you call it?</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;"A Lovely Devonshire Rose." It
seems to me neat and appropriate; or, as it is a story for Christmas,
how will "A Ray of Arctic Sunlight" do?</p>

<p><i>From Editor to Contributor.</i>&mdash;"A Ray of Arctic Sunlight" is
better for Yule Tide. I have got the very blocks for the illustrations.
Belonged to a book called <i>Travels in the Soudan and Syria</i>. Could
not have found anything more appropriate if I had searched for
centuries. I enclose a little cheque, and offer thousands of thanks
for all the trouble you have taken. It is no idle form when I wish you
the happiest of Christmasses and the most prosperous of New Years!</p>

<p><i>From Contributor to Editor.</i>&mdash;Reciprocation of seasonable compliments.
But I say&mdash;hang it&mdash;you might have made it guineas!</p>

<h2>"A SINGLE-HANDED RUN."</h2>

<blockquote><p>
["It is interesting to watch the methods of obstruction.... Progress
(with the Parish Councils Bill) has been slow enough, but it is impeded with
an artfulness which indicates a certain division of labour among the different
sections of the Unionist army. The first section includes the Liberal
Unionists, whose <i>rôle</i> is ... to take no overt part in the game of mere
talkativeness; the second is the official Tories, who mostly hate the Bill
 ... and lose no opportunity of expressing a guarded but thoroughly
sincere distrust of every portion of it; the third section consists of the
go-as-you-please Lowtherites&mdash;the mere guerillas, who are allowed to
obstruct as much and as long as they please."&mdash;<i>"House and Lobby" in the
"Daily Chronicle."</i>]</p>

<p>(<i>Rough, and rather amateurish, reporter's mems. picked up on the
St. Stephen's Football Grounds during the progress of the big match,
Midlothian United</i> v. <i>Unionists. See illustration, p. 266.</i>)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Football at St. Stephen's looking up! Fine exponents of the
Rugby game. Strong combinations, "Midlothian United" and
"Unionists" met to decide great&mdash;postponed&mdash;fixture. Though
weather favourable, failed somehow to attract the large crowd
usual at matches between these two "sides" of far-famed amateurs.
Enthusiastic followers of the game, however, who turned up
in adequate numbers, rewarded by sight of good, if slow and
unexciting game. Both sides well represented, and the homesters,
who won the toss, played first half from pavilion end of
ground, having wind, which was blowing across ground, a trifle
in their favour.</p>

<p>"Midlothian United," famous team, better known as "<span class="sc">Gladstone's</span>
Men," play well together, and are strong lot, though less
speedy perhaps than their opponents. "Unionists" indeed (made
up from two admirable teams at one time opponents) an extremely
clever, not to say artful, combination. As pick of anciently opposed
sides, wonderful how well they are together, and how unselfishly
they play the game. "Midlothian United" team (which has undergone
numerous changes of late) also fairly well together, and
admirably captain'd.</p>

<p>From kick-off, ball was well returned, and play settled down in
homesters' territory. Later, game of very equal character, each
side looking like scoring, but nothing definite obtained before half
time. Game then ruled a bit slow. Showing good combination,
the visitors' forwards caused home-side some anxiety. Forwards,
however, played very self-denying game, and game largely confined
to the half and three-quarter backs, and in this visitors had
advantage, as "Midlothian United" do not so greatly shine in this
phase of game, whereas, among their opponents, <span class="sc">Bowles</span>, <span class="sc">Long</span>,
<span class="sc">Lowther</span>, and one or two more, very smart and tricky. <span class="sc">Fowler</span>,
however, the great Midlothian forward, played with fine combination
of energy and judgment, made some fine runs, and proved
vastly effective in scrum. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>, <span class="sc">Goschen</span>, and <span class="sc">H.
James</span>, played
very artfully indeed, and "tackled" strongly, and although that
mighty forward <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> less prominent than usual, still, in
doggerel of football-field, it may be said that,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2"><span class="sc">Joe</span>, the Brum,</p>
<p class="i2">Shines in scrum.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Later <span class="sc">Bowles</span>, <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>, <span class="sc">Stanley</span>, <span class="sc">Leighton</span>,
<span class="sc">Lowther</span>,
and <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, were very active for the "Unionists," though
one or two of them seemed sometimes "within measurable distance"
of being pulled up for fouls. <span class="sc">Collings</span> once made tracks but failed
to pass <span class="sc">Rigby</span>, who throughout played a sound game at back for the
Midlothianites. Not to be denied, the "Unionists" again advanced
to the attack, <span class="sc">Long</span> and <span class="sc">Leighton</span> especially being conspicuous.
<span class="sc">Fowler</span> deprived latter, but <span class="sc">Balfour</span> and <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
rushing up
relieved. Fast and even play then became order, the ball being
taken from one end of ground to other with great rapidity. <span class="sc">Fowler</span>
broke up a determined attack by "Unionists." From a hot scrum
he got possession, and put in a fine single-handed run right down
centre of ground, closely pursued by those determined tacklers,
<span class="sc">Balfour</span>, <span class="sc">James</span>, <span class="sc">Goschen</span>, and the redoubtable Brum,
when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

downstairs!</p>

<p><i>Althea</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Mine had to be left all night in a thorough
draught. Where <i>could</i> Mamma have been, unless&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). I came
home in a smoky cab, and you
know perfectly well this is not the
place to ask me such questions.
Leave the room!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>to herself, as she leaves</i>).
A smoky cab indeed! There's no
smoke without fire&mdash;as Master will
find out before long!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Had your cabman been
giving a smoking party inside his
fourwheeler, or what, Aunt?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> I don't&mdash;yes, I
believe he had. He apologised
for it; it&mdash;it was his birthday.
(<i>To herself.</i>) Oh, dear me, <i>what</i>
makes me tell these dreadful
stories?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey.</i> His birthday! Why,
if you remember, <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, you
<i>said</i> the man had been drinking.
That would <i>account</i> for it! But
did I understand there was to be
<i>another</i> Zenana Meeting, my love?
That seems <i>rather</i> soon, does it
not, after having one only last
Saturday!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I <i>must</i>
go on, or he'll suspect something.
(<i>Aloud, severely.</i>) And why not,
Pa&mdash;pray, why not? You know
what an energetic creature Mrs.
<span class="sc">Cumberbatch</span> is! <i>Can</i> we do too
much for those poor benighted
heathen women? And there was
a great deal that we had to leave
unfinished the other evening.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Dear me, and you
were home so late, too!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Perhaps you disbelieve
my word, Pa? If you do,
<i>say</i> so, and I shall know what to
think! Though <i>what</i> I've done to
deserve such suspicion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>astounded</i>). My
own love, I never for one single moment&mdash;&mdash; Hem, the wife of
Cæsar is above suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with relief</i>). I should hope so, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>;
not that
you are <i>Cæsar</i>&mdash;but there, that is enough of a very painful subject.
Let us say no more about it.</p>

<p><i>Curphew</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm more certain every moment that this
immaculate matron is lying like a prospectus, but what can I do?
I've no proof, and if I had, I couldn't bring myself to&mdash;&mdash; Well, I
must wait, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> What <i>I</i> should like to know is, why Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>
still remains here after we have distinctly informed him that we do
not desire his further acquaintance?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Curph.</span> Before I go, let me say this: that I have no intention of
giving up your daughter until she gives up me. I am in a position
to marry and support her, and if you refuse your consent, you will
only reduce us to the painful necessity of doing without it.</p>

<blockquote><p>
      [<span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>intimates her entire acquiescence in this ultimatum</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> We will never consent to give our daughter to a
notorious music-hall singer&mdash;<i>never</i>!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> That objection is easily met. I am no longer a music-hall
singer. I have left the profession for ever; not that I consider it
any disgrace to belong to it, but I prefer to live by my pen in
future. (<i>To</i> Mr. T.) I appeal to <i>you</i>, Sir. You had no objection
before; what can you have now?</p>

<blockquote><p>
      [Mr. T. <i>opens his lips inaudibly</i>.

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/268-800.png"><img src="images/268-300.png" width="300" height="473" alt="'Well, Ma'am, this is the last place I expected to find you in!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Well, Ma'am, this is the <i>last</i> place I expected to find
you in!"</p></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Tell him, Pa, that in the circle in which <i>we</i> move, the
remotest connection with&mdash;with a music-hall would be justly considered
as an indelible disgrace.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>sotto voce</i>). No, hang it, Uncle! It's no business of
mine,
and I'm not going to shove my oar in; but still you know as well
as I do that <i>you</i> can't decently take that line, whatever Aunt
may do!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> I heard you, <span class="sc">Charles</span>. So, Pa, there <i>is</i>
something
you have been hiding from me? I felt positive there was some
mystery about that box. Now I <i>will</i> know it. <span class="sc">Althea</span>, leave us!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> There is nothing she had better not hear&mdash;<i>now</i>, my
love. It&mdash;it's true I would rather have kept it from you, but I'd
better tell you&mdash;I'd better tell you. The fact is that, without being
in the least aware of it&mdash;I was under the impression I was investing in
a gold-mine&mdash;I&mdash;I became the proprietor of several shares in the
Eldorado Music-hall.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). You, Sir! you were a shareholder all the time!
Is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>bewildered</i>). Why,
but you <i>knew</i>! I consulted you at the
Junction about whether I ought to
retain the shares or not, and you advised
me to go and judge for myself!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> I assure you I thought
we were talking about <i>my</i> connection
with the Eldorado, not yours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> So, Pa, by your own
story you found yourself in possession
of those horrible wicked shares,
and you actually hesitated what to
do! You considered it necessary
to&mdash;to visit the scene!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Indeed. I never actually
went, my love. And&mdash;and Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew</span> assured me the establishment
was quite respectably conducted,
under the supervision of the
London County Council; and then
there was the dividend&mdash;seventy
per cent. on only five hundred
pounds&mdash;three hundred and fifty a
year, <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>; it&mdash;it seemed a
pity to give it up!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, impressed</i>).
Three hundred and fifty
a year! Why we can keep our
carriage on it! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well,
Pa, of course&mdash;as you bought the
shares under a misapprehension&mdash;and
I'm bound to say <i>this</i> for the
Eldorado, that there was nothing
positively objectionable in the performance
so far as <i>I</i> could&mdash;(<i>correcting
herself hastily</i>)&mdash;have ever
been given to understand&mdash;why,
I'm the last to blame you.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>overjoyed</i>). Ah, my
dear love! I scarcely dared to
hope for this leniency. But I never
would have gone&mdash;oh, never. Why,
I could never have looked you in
the face again if I had!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with a twinge</i>). That <i>depends</i>, Pa; it is quite
possible
to go to such places, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Yes, but you see I <i>didn't</i> go, my dear. I found I
couldn't really bring myself to visit it when it came to the point, so
I went to call on <span class="sc">Larkins</span> instead, as it was on his advice I had
taken the shares, and I told him my difficulty, and he quite sympathised
with my scruples, and most good-naturedly offered to take
them off my hands.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> But surely, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>, you never gave up three
hundred and fifty a year without so much as consulting Me!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> You can't count on such dividends as a certainty, you
know, Aunt, and I've no doubt Uncle got rid of them at a very
good figure; they've been going up like sky-rockets!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>mollified</i>). Of course if your Uncle did <i>that</i>,
I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Well, you see, my love, <span class="sc">Charles</span> very properly pointed
out to me that there was no moral difference between that and
keeping the shares, and&mdash;and <span class="sc">Larkins</span> took the same view himself;
so (I'm sure, <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, you will consider I have only done what
was my strict duty!) I agreed to surrender the shares for just what
I paid for them&mdash;five hundred pounds&mdash;and my conscience is clear.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> If it's no clearer than your <i>head</i>, Pa&mdash;&mdash; I never
heard of such downright Quixotism! As if <i>you</i> could be held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg 269]</span>
responsible; as if anyone here need <i>know</i>! I call it folly&mdash;sheer
ruinous folly!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>opening the door&mdash;to</i> Mr. T.). A young gentleman to see
you, Sir; says he comes from Mr. <span class="sc">Larkins</span>, with a paper to be filled
up. I've shown him into the study, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Ah, to be sure, yes; tell him I'll come. (<i>To</i> Mrs. T.)
It's about those shares; <span class="sc">Larkins</span> said he would send a clerk down to
complete the transfer.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> So it isn't completed <i>yet</i>? Mr. <span class="sc">Larkins</span> has
been
trying to get the better of you, Pa; but it's not too late, fortunately.
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>.) Show the young man in here. <i>I</i> wish to see
him
about this business. (<i>As</i> <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> <i>goes</i>.) I shall insist
on the fair market value of the shares being paid before you put your signature
to any document whatever; leave this entirely to me, Pa. I <i>think</i>
I shall be a match for any young&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>returning</i>). Mr. <span class="sc">Jannaway</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> (<i>to</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>). From Mr. <span class="sc">Larkins</span>,
Sir. Brought a transfer-deed for your signature.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Gracious goodness! It's the man whose
ears I boxed at the Eldorado! What <i>shall</i> I do?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>She seizes the current number of "The Quiver," and retires behind it.</i>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He's <i>awfully</i> like the young man in that
box on Saturday! If Mamma really <i>was</i> there! (<i>She glances at</i> Mrs. T.,
<i>in whose hands "The Quiver" is rustling audibly</i>.) Ah, then I
<i>wasn't</i> mistaken. Oh, how dreadful if he should recognise her!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> My signature? Yes, yes, yes, to be sure, just so; but
the fact is, I&mdash;I've been thinking over the matter, and&mdash;and&mdash;but
that lady by the window will explain my views.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>in a muffled voice, from behind "The Quiver"</i>). I&mdash;I
shall do nothing of the sort. I&mdash;I'm busy. Sign whatever the
young man wants, Pa, and don't bother <i>me</i> about it!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). That's rum. Where have I heard that
voice? And "<i>Pa</i>," too! <i>Very</i> rum!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Oh, very well, my love; I only thought&mdash;but I'll sign.
I'll sign. Only, I rather fancy you're sitting just in front of
the writing materials, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> (<i>gallantly</i>). Allow <i>me</i>! (<i>He goes towards</i>
Mrs. T.'s <i>chair. "The Quiver" treacherously collapses at the critical
moment; their eyes meet.</i>) Well, ma'am, this is the <i>last</i> place I

Mr. <span class="sc">Dredferley Cornerd</span>,

smoothes his throbbing brow.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. D. C.</i> <span class="sc">James</span>, let us nerve ourselves to it once more! Let
us remember <span class="sc">Duty</span>! Come; we will plunge at once into the thick
of it. What is <span class="sc">Jane</span> to have?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dredferley Cornerd</i> (<i>hurling himself from his chair, his eye
ablaze with unspeakable hate</i>). Nothing&mdash;a bottle of poison&mdash;a
dynamite bomb&mdash;the cat-o'-nine tails! Hear me, <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>. One
year ago, at this very season that brings this haunting, maddening
torture of the selection of Christmas presents, my sister <span class="sc">Jane</span> sent
us that ormolu clock which at this very moment glares upon us
from that mantel-piece! I loathe ormolu. Had we not laboured
and struggled, you and I, to furnish this, our dining-room, in
perfect taste, all in old oak and Flemish pottery. Then, in the very
moment of our triumph, arrived that loathsome clock of ormolu, and
crushed our whole design! It <i>had</i> to go there, lest we gave offence.
I hate my sister <span class="sc">Jane</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D. C.</i> Well, let us, for the moment, then, dismiss your
sister <span class="sc">Jane</span>. Now what are we to give to <span class="sc">Joseph</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. D. C.</i> <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>, I loathe that man! Well knowing
how I hated summer-houses&mdash;abominations filled with creeping
horrors&mdash;he gave me one just seven years ago. It makes our garden
hideous to this day; I will <i>not</i> speak of him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D. C.</i> Well, then, the <span class="sc">Joneses</span>. They gave <i>us</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. D. C.</i> <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>, I know they did. We have to eat them
still whenever they drop in to meals. A lamprey makes me&mdash;(<i>shudders</i>)
ugh! They give us seven barrels twice a year! No,
<span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>; I will not threaten you, but breathe their name no
more.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D. C.</i> Well, put them off. But now there's Mrs.
<span class="sc">Blenkinsop</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. D. C.</i> The cat! She gave us six outrageous oleographs, all
green and yellow, framed in blazing gold, and said we ought to
hang them in the hall. Our hall is Japanese; we'd left six spaces
for kakemonos of subdued design, and there we had to hang those
oleographs. I loathe our hall&mdash;I never enter it&mdash;I come round always
by the garden door! Woman, you madden me! You'll mention
next the hated name of Cousin <span class="sc">Ichabod</span>&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D. C.</i> I was about to.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/269b-300.png"><img src="images/269b-150.png" width="150" height="126" alt="He swoons." /></a></div>

<p><i>Mr. D. C.</i> Cousin <span class="sc">Ichabod</span> presented to me, fifteen years ago, a
pair of silver brushes. At the time I had but little hair; that very
year I lost the rest. Still those accursed brushes mockingly gibber
on my dressing-table. They <i>must</i> be there, for Cousin <span class="sc">Ichabod</span>
drops in at unexpected moments! Once I hurled them from the
window. One of them caught <span class="sc">Ichabod</span>, approaching up the path,
over the eye, and raised a livid bump. I writhe with detestation of
his name. Would that that brush&mdash;&mdash; Unhand me, <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>;
see, I am calm. For years have thoughtless friends encumbered us
with Christmas presents quite unsuited to our tastes and our requirements.
What do we want with seven berceaunettes (our
children being two), with fifteen inkstands, with twenty biscuit
boxes, and thirty-five illuminated hanging almanacks? For years
we've played the shameless hypocrite, pretending to adore these
gruesome gifts; and now I bid you mark me, <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>; I mean
<span class="sc">Revenge</span>. Yes, let us to the council, and plan what gifts to such
and such; the most unsuitable that we can hit on. Here's
<span class="sc">Parker's</span> list, and <span class="sc">Porringe's</span>, and <span class="sc">Spriteley's</span>. Come,
here are wedding dresses; sister <span class="sc">Jane</span> is sixty and a spinster; I will send
her a wedding gown&mdash;(<i>hysterically</i>) a dozen wedding gowns!
Write, <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>, to <span class="sc">Parker</span> for a dozen. Then <span class="sc">Joseph</span>.
<span class="sc">Joseph</span>,
ha! I have it; <span class="sc">Joseph</span> goes mad with fright on passing near a dog.
To-morrow I will seek the Lost Dogs' Home,
and pick out fifty of the savagest&mdash;all bloodhounds,
mark you! I will drag the pack to
<span class="sc">Joseph's</span> door, and leave them with the maid.
And now the <span class="sc">Joneses</span>. Silence, <span class="sc">Mary-Ann</span>!
I do not need cold water on my temples!
You shall <i>not</i> stroke my head, and murmur
"Shish!" You shall <i>not</i> scream for cook, and
<span class="sc">Blenkinsop</span>, and <span class="sc">George</span>, and <span class="sc">Jane</span>. I'm
calm. The <span class="sc">Joneses</span>&mdash;hurr! Let me get at them! Back&mdash;unhand
me! Ha!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>NEW LIGHTS FOR OLD.</h3>

<p>On religious instruction being entirely
omitted from the School Board
curriculum, the following suggestions
towards the formation of a moral and
physical catechism may possibly be of
use:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> There was at one time
much debating about a so-called "Conscience
Clause." Now I will ask you
what are we to understand by the word
"conscience"?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> It is only a name for the
action of the liver in its various states.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is a "troubled conscience"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It may arise from indigestion, or
from an east wind, or from many other
causes which affect different persons,
with differing livers, in a variety of
ways.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> In what sense do you recognise
"conscience" as "an inward monitor"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Its recognition as such depends
on the extent of each individual's
acquaintance with his own particular
physical organisation as differentiated
from that of others. In some cases
the "voice of the inward monitor"
may point to blue pill, and in others
it may indicate moderated remedies.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the moral law?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The so-called moral law is purely
hygienic. Perfect health is perfect
morality. <i>Mens sana in corpore sano.</i>
"Law," so-called, is for the protection
of the "good livers," and for the
punishment of the "evil livers."
<i>Voilà tout!</i></p>

<h3 class="sans">A CHANCE FOR THE BRIEFLESS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I am a
briefless barrister, and I wish to
throw myself upon your generosity
by asking you to allow me
to make a suggestion which will
be of great public interest, and
incidentally help me to make my
fortune. All London to-day is
placarded with a thrilling picture
of the Law-Court Scene in <i>A
Woman's Revenge</i>. My suggestion
is&mdash;Why not have <i>real</i>
barristers? The theatre to-day
is nothing if not realistic. Drury
Lane has its race-horses, Ibsenity
its ghosts&mdash;why should not the
Adelphi take the town by storm
with its barristers? The actor
may, no doubt does, act the part
admirably, but who can contend
that he can possibly do so as well
as could a real, actual barrister,
who would know that he was
striving not merely for the applause
of the moment, but for the
guinead briefs of the future? If
Messrs. <span class="sc">Gatti</span> will undertake to
accept the plan, I will undertake
to provide the barristers. The
programme would then run:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind2">
<i>Sir John Blacklock, Q.C.</i> (<i>Counsel
for the Crown</i>) &nbsp;. . .&nbsp; Mr.
A. B., 102, Temple Gardens,
Temple, E.C.
</p>

<p>What we briefless barristers
want in these hard times is merely
the chance. I look to Messrs.
<span class="sc">Gatti</span> to give it to us. I ought
to add that the above address,
though, in point of fact, it is my
own, is given purely by way of
illustration, and in no way to
advertise myself, though should
anyone wish to consult&mdash;again, of
course, purely with reference to
this suggestion&mdash;the way to my
chambers from the Strand is down
Middle Temple Lane, whilst the
Temple Station is just three
minutes' walk. I am, Sir, your
obliged servant.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, November 27.</i>&mdash;Another night with
Parish Councils Bill, dull as usual, save for one thrilling moment.
Happened just before dinner. <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> accepted Amendment
making responsible for expenses or damage those who had
summoned meetings in Parish School. Sudden tumult below
Gangway in Radical camp; Question put from Chair that Amendment
be added to Bill. <span class="sc">Logan</span> raised stentorian shout of "No!"
Chairman repeated Question; hubbub increased; amid it <span class="sc">Logan</span>
seen waving arms aloft like windmill that had suddenly remembered
an appointment. <span class="sc">Mellor's</span> face grew a shade mellerer,
not to say paler. Set his lips, and there was a gleam in his eye
reminiscent of <span class="sc">Beerbohm Tree's</span> when seated on the gargoyle of
Canterbury Cathedral. On memorable night in summer-time
<span class="sc">Logan</span> had taken him at disadvantage. Had executed flank movement,
and so almost come down on <span class="sc">Carson's</span> knee on Chairman's
left rear. Now, if he meant business, he would catch the Chairman's
eye; and probably something else.</p>

<p>During interval when House cleared for division <span class="sc">Acland</span>, who,
having a holiday, has been out helping <span class="sc">Fowler</span>, left Treasury
bench; cautiously but nimbly crossed gangway; amid buzz of admiration
from assembly that ever admires personal courage, entered the
<span class="sc">Logan's</span> den. Sat down in very midst of excited Radicals; proposed
to argue matter out. Effect upon <span class="sc">Logan</span> maddening.
Windmill remembered another appointment more pressing than the
last. Members, anxious for <span class="sc">Acland's</span> safety, looked round for <span class="sc">Hayes
Fisher</span>. The <span class="sc">Logan</span> Tamer not in his place; sand rapidly running
out of glass on table; another minute question would be put again;
if <span class="sc">Logan</span> insisted division must be taken, split manifested in
Ministerial ranks, and a quarter of an hour wasted. <span class="sc">Acland</span>,
undaunted, pegged away persuasively; windmill still went round,
but less furiously; half a minute and last sands would run out.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Logan</span> glanced towards table; Chairman's glittering eye fixed
upon him. Effect magical. <span class="sc">Logan</span> slowly rose and walked towards
Bar; crowd thronging in at sound of division bell respectfully
opened their ranks as he approached. Like accomplished husband
in case that recently occupied attention of Sir <span class="sc">Francis Jeune</span>,
<span class="sc">Logan</span> "can use 'em a bit." Suppose he were to begin promiscuously
with the crowd at the Bar! Had no such intention. At
other side of the Bar he was technically out of the House. What
others did whilst he stood there would leave no sear on his conscience.
When question was put again, and Chairman declared "The Ayes
have it," there was no responsive angry shout of "No!" The crisis
was passed, but what it cost the Chairman, and how it would have
been but for <span class="sc">Acland's</span> fearless foray, who can tell?</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The <span class="sc">Man from Shropshire</span> in great form to-day.
Original <i>Mr. Gridley</i> was, according to records of Court of Chancery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span>
accustomed to haunt the Court, and, at close of day's proceedings,
address the Chancellor. <span class="sc">Stanley Leighton</span> knows no such
limitation. 'Tis true he is generally found on his legs at moment
of adjournment, shouting and gesticulating, whilst suborned and
iniquitous Ministerialists (answering to tipstaves in Court of Chancery)
howl him down. That only an incident in day's proceedings.
Our <span class="sc">Man from Shropshire</span> begins as soon as his Lordship&mdash;I mean
the Chairman&mdash;takes his seat. At brief intervals, which make
openings for <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>, our <i>Mr. Gridley</i> is at it all through the
sitting of the Court.</p>

<p>To-night <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> took mean advantage of the suitor. That
person had amendment on paper which if added to Bill meant nothing
worse than surplusage. Rising from his usual place at back of
Court, he began prodigious speech in support of amendment.
Expected, in accordance with usage, to go on for quarter of an
hour or twenty minutes; <span class="sc">Fowler</span> would say couldn't accept
Amendment; <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> would talk for quarter of an hour; perhaps
Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, having clapped the pilot in irons, would
put in an oar; and <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> might say a few words. Then <span class="sc">Walter
Long</span> or <span class="sc">Hicks-Beach</span> would rise from Front Opposition Bench,
protest fullest appreciation of Amendment, declare it indispensable
to success of Bill, but in circumstances, observing obstinacy of
Minister, and impatience of gentlemen below Gangway opposite,
advise hon. friend not to press it. <span class="sc">The Man from Shropshire</span>
would make another speech, thanking right hon. friend for his
remarks, in deference to which he will withdraw, although&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">The Persuasive Acland and the Pugilistic Logan.</p></div>

<p>Here another speech, about as long as the distance from
Shrewsbury to Wem. Thus an hour pleasantly and agreeably
disposed of, <span class="sc">Man from Shropshire</span> takes breath, not that he
wants it; a little later, comes up frowning with another Amendment,
or a rambling speech in support of one moved by <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fowler's</span> strategy deprived him of this accustomed round of
luxury. But if President of Local Government Board thought he
had circumvented <span class="sc">The Man from Shropshire</span> he was as mistaken
as the Chancellor in another court who used to stare at the ruined
chancery suitor and blandly protest that, legally, he was unaware of
his existence. Charm of speeches by Member for Oswestry division
of Shropshire is their illimitable adaptability. Will suit any
purpose, any opportunity. If not delivered at opening of sitting
upon his own Amendment, will come in admirably on somebody else's
Amendment to another line of Clause dealt with at later hour by
another member. Thus, when <span class="sc">Griffith-Boscawen</span> delivered
prodigious oration in presenting Amendment standing in the name
of <span class="sc">Hulse</span>, <span class="sc">The Man from Shropshire</span>, bounding to his feet,
waved his arms, and in them caught the Chairman's eye. A
priceless opportunity this. To deliver your own speech prepared
for your own Amendment a commonplace performance. To deliver
it either for or against (doesn't matter which) an Amendment
moved by another man, on behalf of a third man, is a luxury to be
appreciated only by a <i>gourmet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Man from Shropshire</span> audibly smacks his lips over it. The
other noise you hear is baffled <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> grinding his teeth.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Reached Clause VII. Parish Councils Bill.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/276b-900.png"><img src="images/276b-300.png" width="300" height="346" alt="The Shropshire Windmill." /></a>
<p class="center">The Shropshire Windmill.</p></div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Some people inclined to regard as sufficient an arrangement
that keeps them sitting day after day from three o'clock in
afternoon to midnight listening to talk about Parish Councils.
Others want a little more. <span class="sc">Channing</span> suggests House shall sit on
Saturdays, and, on four days a week, shall commence business at
noon, putting in a twelve hour day. <span class="sc">Barrow</span> assents to that, but
thinks twelve o'clock Rule should be suspended, so that, for fuller
luxury, House meeting at noon may, an' it please, sit all night.
No one yet proposed to sit on Sunday and Christmas Day; that will
follow as natural consequence. <span class="sc">The Man from Shropshire</span>, breaking
out in fresh place, joins in conversation. Asks Mr. G. if he is
aware that scores of Members are ill through overwork, and whether,
instead of lengthening sittings, he will not rather shorten them.</p>

<p>Expected when Mr. G. rose he would make obvious retort that
since Bill has been in Committee there is not single sitting that
might not have been shortened by at least an hour if <span class="sc">The Man
from Shropshire</span> had restrained his tendency to irrelevant babble.
Mr. G. leaves that unsaid; is very firm about sitting till all
necessary business is done; conditionally promises Saturday sitting;
announces meeting of Cabinet to consider measures for expediting
Bill. After this go into Committee, and succeed in not expediting
progress. Night unspeakably dull.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Reached Clause IX. Parish Councils Bill. Disposed
of eight Clauses in eleven sittings. This leaves sixty-three
more, not to mention new Clauses. If it takes eleven sittings to clear
off eight Clauses, at what date, assuming same rate of progress, shall
we be through a Bill that contains seventy-one? Small boys thinking
of coming home for Christmas holidays please do this sum.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to see Mr. G. just now explaining to Opposition
that if they weren't good boys they'd be kept in to-morrow. Not
that he put it in that coarse way. <span class="sc">Storey</span>, coming to his assistance
in task of directing business of House, had, as Mr. G. put it with a
positive pang of pain in his voice, invited him to assume attitude of
censor of proceedings in Committee on Parish Councils Bill.</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. G., with an effort recovering himself, "I am
not entitled to do." All he had to say was that under present
Standing Orders a Saturday Sitting would naturally follow unless
a Minister interposed with Motion preventing it. <span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span>
sitting by his side was looking forward anxiously to pleasure of
making such a Motion. It would be cruel disappointment to an
amiable man if circumstances so shaped themselves as to forbid him
the pleasure and gratification of rising on stroke of midnight and
moving that House do adjourn till Monday. But&mdash;here Mr. G. shook
his head and his voice thrilled with infinite pathos&mdash;business must be
done. If, in short, Committee passed 9th and 10th Clauses of Bill,
<span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span> would move adjournment till Monday. "If unfortunately,"
he added, "any miscarriage should occur he would not be
in a position to make the motion." <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> half rose
from his seat as if to catch the drooping figure of his right hon. friend
overcome with emotion. But Mr. G., waving him off, sank slowly
back into his seat and shudderingly closed his eyes, as if to shut out
picture of gentlemen opposite spending Saturday in further consideration
of Parish Councils Bill. <span class="sc">Goschen</span> said it was too large
an order. Couldn't possibly be done in the time. But it was.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Got up to Clause X. and nearly finished it.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
